## 💡 Abstract

We propose a novel framework to convert any 2D videos to immersive stereoscopic 3D ones that can be viewed on different display devices, like 3D Glasses, Apple Vision Pro and 3D Display. It can be applied to various video sources, such as movies, vlogs, 3D cartoons, and AIGC videos.

## 📣 News
- `2024/12/27` We released our inference code and model weights.
- `2024/09/11` We submitted our technical report on arXiv and released our project page.

## 🎞️ Showcases
Here we show some examples of input videos and their corresponding stereo outputs in Anaglyph 3D format.

## 🛠️ Installation

#### 1. Set up the environment
We run our code on Python 3.8 and Cuda 11.8.
You can use Anaconda or Docker to build this basic environment.

#### 2. Clone the repo
```bash
# use --recursive to clone the dependent submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TencentARC/StereoCrafter
cd StereoCrafter
```

#### 3. Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Install customized 'Forward-Warp' package for forward splatting
```
cd ./dependency/Forward-Warp
chmod a+x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## 🛠️ Installation with Docker

#### 1. Set up the environment
Docker will run the code on Python 3.8 and Cuda 11.8.
You need to install Docker with CUDA support first.

#### 2. Clone the repo
```bash
# use --recursive to clone the dependent submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TencentARC/StereoCrafter
cd StereoCrafter
```

#### 3. Download models
Please refer to "📦 Model Weights" for downloading the models.

#### 4. Start the Docker image
```bash
docker compose run stereo_crafter --build --remove-orphans
```

## 📦 Model Weights

#### 1. Download the [SVD img2vid model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1) for the image encoder and VAE.

```bash
# in StereoCrafter project root directory
cd ./weights
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1
```

#### 2. Download the [DepthCrafter model](https://huggingface.co/tencent/DepthCrafter) for the video depth estimation.
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/tencent/DepthCrafter
```

#### 3. Download the [StereoCrafter model](https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/StereoCrafter) for the stereo video generation.
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/StereoCrafter
```


## 🔄 Inference

Script:

```bash
# in StereoCrafter project root directory
sh run_inference.sh
```

There are two main steps in this script for generating stereo video.

#### 1. Depth-Based Video Splatting Using the Video Depth from DepthCrafter
Execute the following command:
```bash
python depth_splatting_inference.py --pre_trained_path [PATH] --unet_path [PATH]
                                    --input_video_path [PATH] --output_video_path [PATH]
```
Arguments:
- `--pre_trained_path`: Path to the SVD img2vid model weights (e.g., `./weights/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1`).
- `--unet_path`: Path to the DepthCrafter model weights (e.g., `./weights/DepthCrafter`).
- `--input_video_path`: Path to the input video (e.g., `./source_video/camel.mp4`).
- `--output_video_path`: Path to the output video (e.g., `./outputs/camel_splatting_results.mp4`).
- `--max_disp`: Parameter controlling the maximum disparity between the generated right video and the input left video. Default value is `20` pixels.

The first step generates a video grid with input video, visualized depth map, occlusion mask, and splatting right video, as shown below:

#### 2. Stereo Video Inpainting of the Splatting Video
Execute the following command:
```bash
python inpainting_inference.py --pre_trained_path [PATH] --unet_path [PATH]
                               --input_video_path [PATH] --save_dir [PATH]
```
Arguments:
- `--pre_trained_path`: Path to the SVD img2vid model weights (e.g., `./weights/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1`).
- `--unet_path`: Path to the StereoCrafter model weights (e.g., `./weights/StereoCrafter`).
- `--input_video_path`: Path to the splatting video result generated by the first stage (e.g., `./outputs/camel_splatting_results.mp4`).
- `--save_dir`: Directory for the output stereo video (e.g., `./outputs`).
- `--tile_num`: The number of tiles in width and height dimensions for tiled processing, which allows for handling high resolution input without requiring more GPU memory. The default value is `1` (1 $\times$ 1 tile). For input videos with a resolution of 2K or higher, you could use more tiles to avoid running out of memory.

The stereo video inpainting generates the stereo video result in side-by-side format and anaglyph 3D format, as shown below:
